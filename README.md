# NLS Tab Limiter

### Forked from iljared98's Tab Limiter extension for Chrome.

This fork has been adjusted to work with Manifest V3, as V2 will be deprecated in 2023. Most of the minor changes
involve removing the form fields and changing V2 API calls to use the newer V3 ones. The form removal is to force
a set amount of tabs as defined in background.js, since this extension will primarily be aimed towards preventing
tab abuse on student-issued Chromebooks.
